# Students Hub

Students Hub is a website made by [`Leone Lorenzo`][l] and [`Marguerettaz Andr√©`][a] with the aim of giving all students the opportunity to **`give and receive`** repetitions, earning internal **credits** that can be used to buy internal features or converted into real money at the end of the month.

## The project

_Students Hub_ is made with [`ReactJs`][r] and [`Bootstrap`][b] (using also the resources of [`React-Bootstrap`][r-b])


## **Our Goal**

Our goal is to **revolutionise** the concept of repetition, eradicating the **common idea** of a real professor giving repetitions, when we know very well that our friends and peers who have skills are the first to help us understand a concept unknown to us.
